Virtual Programming Lab examples 

The aim of this site is to show the experience of using a black-box based automatic grading system, VPL (Virtual Programming Lab https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/). To do it, several examples of VPL configuration will be shown: use of automatic tests, junit, databases, checking programming styles, etc. This site will not show how to install, setup or configure this tool.

We have been using VPL for years in different degrees and with different programming languages at the Centro Universitario de MÃ©rida (http://cume.unex.es) of the University of Extremadura (http://www.unex.es) in Spain, achieving satisfactory results in all of them.

Firstly, the operation of VPL will be shown, i.e. a brief introduction to this amazing tool (01_Introduction). Secondly, we will explain how to create a simple activity (02_simple_vpl_task). And finally, more complex examples will be shown (03_complext_vpl_task).

Recently, at least for me, a new application to make programming quizzes has appeared (VPL Question: https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_vplquestion). VPL Question allows us to focus on a specific part of programming languages. I think this application is a must for the first year of a degree in programming languages. To use it, you need the VPL plugins. It will also be shown (04_VPL_Question).
