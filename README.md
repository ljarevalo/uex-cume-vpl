Virtual Programming Lab examples 

The aim of this site is to show the experience of using an existing black-box-based automatic grading system, VPL (Virtual Programming Lab https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/). To do it, several VPL configuration examples will be shown: using automated test, junit, databases, checking programming styles, etc. In this site, how to install, to setup or configure this tool will not be shown.

We have been using it for years in different degrees and with different programming languages in Centro Universitario de MÃ©rida (http://cume.unex.es) in the University of Extremadura (http://www.unex.es) in Spain, achieving satisfactories results in all of them.

The first step will be to show how VPL works out, that is, a brief introduction to this amazing tool (01_Introduction). Secondly how to create a simple activity will be explained (02_simple_vpl_task). And finally, more complex examples will be shown (03_complext_vpl_task). 

Recently, at least for me, a new application to make programming quizzes (VPL Question: https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_vplquestion) has been released which allows us to focus on a specific part of programming languages. I think this application is mandatory for the first course in a degree in programming languages. To use it, it is neccesary the VPL plugins. It will be shown too (04_VPL_Question).
