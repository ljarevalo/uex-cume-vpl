Virtual Programming Lab examples 

The aim of this site is to show the experience of using an existing black-box-based automatic grading system, VPL (Virtual Programming Lab https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/). We have been using for years in different degrees and with different programming languages, achieving a satisfactory results in all of them.

The first step will be to show how VPL works out, that is, how to create an activity in VPL. Secondly how to create automated tests will be shown using the basic features of this tool. Finally we will show in example more complex.
