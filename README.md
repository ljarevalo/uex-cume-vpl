Virtual Programming Lab examples 

The aim of this site is to show the experience of using an existing black-box-based automatic grading system, VPL (Virtual Programming Lab https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/). To do it, several VPL configuration examples will be shown: using automated test, junit, databases, checking programming styles, etc. We have been using for years in different degrees and with different programming languages, achieving a satisfactory results in all of them. In this site, how to install, to setup this tool will not be shown

The first step will be to show how VPL works out, that is, a brief introduction to this amazing tool. Secondly how to create a simple activity will be explained. Next how to create automated tests will be shown using the basic features of this tool. Finally we will show in example more complex.
